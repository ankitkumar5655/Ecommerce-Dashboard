Ecommerce-Dashboard -
This project is a subpart of the project infinite-info that allows the users to access the dashboard for adding, updating, displaying, and removing the products efficiently. It is completely built into Node.js for good performance and the ability to process large amounts of data simultaneously. It never lets you stop syncing the data between the client and server. Its front-end part works on React JS, which gives you seamless use of a single-page web application that also saves your precious time. No need to think about the security of your credentials. Your credentials are safe with JWT, which offers users strong authentication and authorization functionalities. I hope you will love this project. I will contribute to adding more features to the project in the upcoming months, so stay tuned with me. Happy Scrolling !
